Resistance to change can hinder progress and productivity. Here's how to address it:

* **Effective Communication**: Clearly communicate the reasons for the change, the benefits, and how it aligns with the organization's goals. Address concerns and provide support to help employees navigate through the transition.

An overwhelming workload and employee burnout can significantly impact productivity. Consider these strategies:
